In this comprehensive project, the focus was on analyzing the optimal playing eleven for the Indian Cricket Team in the ICC World Cup 2023 using PowerBI. Initially, a thorough examination of the dataset was conducted, followed by meticulous feature engineering to identify the most pertinent aspects for analysis. 

Here is a demo of the final PowerBI dashboard:

Given the presence of numerous inconsistencies in the initial dataset, extensive data preprocessing using the Pandas library in Python was undertaken to ensure data integrity and cleanliness. Moreover, an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to unearth valuable patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Delving deeper into player selection, critical factors such as recent form, historical performances, match conditions, and individual player roles were carefully considered. This analysis culminated in the strategic selection of four batsmen for the top order, two all-rounders, one wicketkeeper, and four bowlers, forming the optimal playing eleven.

The insights gleaned from this rigorous analysis are presented comprehensively through a dynamic PowerBI dashboard, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of the decision-making process behind team selection for the ICC World Cup 2023.
